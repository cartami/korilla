Korrila React Receipts

Korilla is a Korean barbecue taco truck that makes thousands of hungry customers happy every year.

Their CEO is thinking of updating their short order tracking system using React.

Build a prototype of this short order receipts tracker.
Part 1: Get Started

Create a new folder for this project. (npx create-react-app korilla-receipts)
Part 2: Sample Receipts

You'll be rendering some sample receipts:

const receipt1 =
  {
    person: 'Karolin',
    order: {
      main: 'Burrito',
      protein: 'Organic Tofu',
      rice: 'Purple Rice',
      sauce: 'Green Crack',
      toppings: [
        'Baby Bok Choy', 'Cucumber Kimchi'
      ],
      drink: 'Korchata',
      cost: 22
    },
    paid: false
  }
const receipt2 = {
  person: 'Jerrica',
  order: {
    main: 'Rice Bowl',
    protein: 'Ginger Soy Chix',
    rice: 'Sticky Rice',
    sauce: 'Korilla',
    toppings: [
      'Yuzu Pickled Sweet Pepper', 'Kale'
    ],
    drink: 'Korchata',
    cost: 19
  },
  paid: false
}
const receipt3 = {
  person: 'Matt',
  order: {
    main: 'Salad Bowl',
    protein: 'Organic Tofu',
    rice: 'none',
    sauce: "K'lla",
    toppings: [
      'Blue Potato Salad', 'Pico De Gallo', 'Red Kimchi'
    ],
    drink: 'Sparkling Blood Orange Soda',
    cost: 20
  },
  paid: true
}

    Make a Receipt component that renders the first receipt's
        person
        order
            main
            protein
            rice
            sauce
            drink
            cost

Hungry for More: render the toppings

Make two more Receipt components so that you get a view like this (a little css provided for clarity, but not required)

Part 3: Conditionally Render the receipts if they have been paid or not

Right now, all the receipts are not paid ( paid: false)

Set up a ternary operator to display the receipt if it has not been paid.

Then go into the receipt data and change the value to true and check that the receipt will not display

Matt has settled his bill

To see the React tab in the Dev Console, you have to download it as a Chrome Extension. (Check out the React Developer Tools (Links to an external site.) extension)

Part 4: Refactor for Dynamic Rendering

3 receipts is pretty limiting. Let's put them in an array and then map over them for rendering.

Update your code so it renders the same, but instead of hard coding 3 receipts, it maps over the array.

const receipts = [
  {
    person: 'Karolin',
    order: {
      main: 'Burrito',
      protein: 'Organic Tofu',
      rice: 'Purple Rice',
      sauce: 'Green Crack',
      toppings: [
        'Baby Bok Choy', 'Cucumber Kimchi'
      ],
      drink: 'Korchata',
      cost: 22
    },
    paid: false
  },
  {
    person: 'Mark',
    order: {
      main: 'Rice Bowl',
      protein: 'Ginger Soy Chix',
      rice: 'Sticky Rice',
      sauce: 'Korilla',
      toppings: [
        'Yuzu Pickled Sweet Pepper', 'Kale'
      ],
      drink: 'Korchata',
      cost: 19
    },
    paid: false
  },
  {
    person: 'Matt',
    order: {
      main: 'Salad Bowl',
      protein: 'Organic Tofu',
      rice: 'none',
      sauce: "K'lla",
      toppings: [
        'Blue Potato Salad', 'Pico De Gallo', 'Red Kimchi'
      ],
      drink: 'Sparkling Blood Orange Soda',
      cost: 20
    },
    paid: true
  }
]
